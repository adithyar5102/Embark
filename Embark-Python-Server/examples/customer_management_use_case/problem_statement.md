Problem Statement

Customer support operations face challenges in efficiently and accurately resolving product-related issues. The process is often fragmented, leading to delays and inconsistent service. A significant amount of time is spent on manual data extraction, initial case triage, and determining the appropriate next steps (e.g., warranty claim, repair, replacement). This results in a poor customer experience, increased operational costs, and a high volume of escalations to human agents for routine inquiries. The core issue is the lack of a structured, automated system that can intelligently process a userâ€™s request, verify product information, analyze the problem, and route the case to the correct resolution path without human intervention for common scenarios.

The current system lacks a clear, data-driven decision framework to handle customer requests. Specifically, it fails to:

Automatically extract and validate key user and product information from unstructured text.

Dynamically route the request to the correct handling process (e.g., replacement, repair, or escalation) based on a set of pre-defined conditions.

Provide an accurate and immediate response to the user, such as a repair estimate or a service confirmation, without requiring a back-and-forth conversation.

Efficiently escalate complex cases to a human agent with a complete and structured summary of the case, rather than a fragmented history.

This inefficiency necessitates the development of a structured, autonomous workflow system that can intelligently manage the entire customer support lifecycle for product issues, from initial contact to resolution.
